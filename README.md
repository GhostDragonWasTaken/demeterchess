I'm not sure if I could drop Komodo 14 into the Launch1 folder, so the only thing you need to do as well as download the repository, is to download Komodo from https://komodochess.com/


Required libraries:

chess - https://pypi.org/project/chess/
matplotlib - https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/
pyqt5 - https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/
