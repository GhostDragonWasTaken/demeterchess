Upon opening, you will be greeted by a menu with only one option, to start the game.*
You will be asked for a product key, which is only obtainable through me.

Once unlocking the game, you will be greeted with a plethera of options and a board, where you can make moves.

The engine will recommend 3 of the best moves (on default).
